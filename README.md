Project using an esp32 where a LED's temperature and position are monitored using a bmp280 and gy-521 sensor. 
The LED is being monitored using the BLYNK app and also displayd on a OLED screen, therefore the choice to use the esp32 cause of the built-in Wi-Fi functionality. 
There are 2 .ino files one without the using of BLYNK and one using the BLYNK-app.
